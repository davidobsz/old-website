        <p>Moon Squad started in 2014 as a squad with 2 members which rapidly grew to around 8 members. <br>
        This squad was based in a game called Apocalypse rising which was made by Gusmanak. <br>
    This squad would endure in Squad Battles with other squads usually in 3v3 battle format to see which squad was victorious <br>
    Whichever squad was victorious would be able to add a point to their record as having won a squad battle.</p>
